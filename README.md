For teams that live in spreadsheets but need them to do more, Rows extends capabilities without abandoning familiar territory.

## Common Questions

**Do I need coding skills to use AI data analysis tools?**

Most modern AI data analysis platforms are specifically built for non-technical users. You ask questions in plain English and the AI handles the code generation behind the scenes. Some platforms like Julius and Quadratic show you the generated code if you're interested, but it's completely optional. Tools like Bricks and Polymer don't expose code at all—they're purely conversational.

**How do these tools handle data security?**

Reputable platforms encrypt data in transit and at rest, maintain SOC 2 compliance, and follow industry security standards. Most importantly, they guarantee your data isn't used to train their AI models, keeping your business information private. Always verify a platform's security certifications before uploading sensitive data, and look for options like single sign-on and role-based access controls if you're working with a team.

**Can these tools replace traditional spreadsheets entirely?**

Not necessarily replace, but extend. Many of these platforms integrate with Excel and Google Sheets, enhancing them with AI capabilities rather than forcing you to abandon familiar tools. Platforms like Quadratic and Rows function as spreadsheet replacements with added intelligence, while others like Julius work best as analytical companions to your existing spreadsheets. The choice depends on whether your workflow centers around spreadsheet structure or data exploration.
